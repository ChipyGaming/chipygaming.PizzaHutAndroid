The Pizza Hut delivery tracking app feature will show customers the location of their order in real time, keeping Pizza Hut competitive with other food delivery companies like Domino’s, Postmates, and Uber Eats.

The customer app’s main screen keeps it simple, displaying a time estimate and the map showing the driver and user location. The bottom sheet with the time can expand, showing the driver details (including car and plate number), order total, and order details.
